6.  What types of problems can AI solve? 
   - AI can solve deterministic, stochastic, discrete, continuous, and adversarial problems, among others.

7.  What are states in AI? 
   - States are the various configurations or conditions that can exist in the environment of an AI problem.

8.  What are operators in AI? 
   - Operators are actions that transition the problem from one state to another.

9.  What is a state space? 
   - State space is the set of all possible states of the problem domain.

10.  What are search strategies in AI? 
    - These are algorithms that dictate the order in which nodes in a state space are expanded to find a solution path.

11.  What is an informed search strategy?

14.  What are heuristic functions? 
    - These are functions that estimate the cost from the current state to the goal state.

15.  What is Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)? 
    - IDA* is an algorithm that combines depth-first search's space-efficiency with A*'s optimality and completeness.

16.  Define a perfect decision game in AI. 
    - It's a game with complete information where the result of every possible move is known.

17.  What is an imperfect decision game? 
    - It's a game where some information is hidden, leading to elements of uncertainty.

    - Planners can use probabilistic reasoning and decision-theoretic approaches to handle uncertainty.

26.   What is a frame problem in AI?  
    - The frame problem is the challenge of specifying what does not change in response to an action, as opposed to what does change.

27.   What is a plan library in hierarchical planning?  
    - A plan library is a repository of predefined plan structures and strategies that can be reused for solving different but similar problems.

28.   What is meant by non-monotonic reasoning in AI?  
    - Non-monot

onic reasoning is reasoning where the introduction of new information can invalidate previous conclusions.

29.   How does a planner use heuristics?  
    - Planners use heuristics to guide the search for plans by estimating the cost or likelihood of reaching the goal from a given state.

30.   What is a deductive database?  
    - A deductive database combines a relational database with a rule-based inference engine to derive new information.

    - Default reasoning allows AI systems to make assumptions in the absence of complete information.

33.   What is a consistency algorithm?  
    - A consistency algorithm checks whether a set of knowledge, rules, or statements can all be true at the same time.

34.   What is qualitative reasoning in AI?  
    - Qualitative reasoning is the ability to reason with qualitative descriptions rather than precise quantitative measures.

35.   What is a reactive planner?  
    - A reactive planner responds to changes in the environment in real-time and adjusts the plan accordingly, rather than following a pre-set sequence of actions.
